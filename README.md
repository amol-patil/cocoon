<!-- Short Description -->

*   Link entries directly to source files (e.g., scanned PDFs) for easy access.
*   Add, edit, and delete your document entries.
*   Organize items as "Permanent" or "Temporary" (temporary items still searchable).
*   **Data stored locally only** in a simple JSON file within your user profile; no cloud sync or external storage.
*   Configure global shortcut, default browser for opening file links, and app behavior (Launch at startup, Show in Dock).
*   Simple, dark-themed overlay interface.

## Installation (macOS)

1.  **Download:** Go to the [Latest Release page](https://github.com/amol-patil/cocoon/releases/latest) on GitHub.
2.  Download the `.dmg` file (e.g., `Cocoon-x.y.z.dmg`).
3.  **Mount:** Double-click the downloaded `.dmg` file to open it.
4.  **Install:** Drag the `Cocoon.app` icon into your `Applications` folder.

**Important First Launch Note:**

> Cocoon is currently distributed without official Apple Developer signing due to the costs involved for free, open-source projects. 
> 
> Because of this, the first time you open Cocoon, macOS Gatekeeper will show a warning like "'Cocoon.app' can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."
> 
> To bypass this **safely for the first launch only**:
> 
> 1.  Locate `Cocoon.app` in your `/Applications` folder.
> 2.  **Right-click** (or Control-click) the `Cocoon.app` icon.
> 3.  Choose **"Open"** from the context menu.
> 4.  A dialog will appear asking if you're sure. Click **"Open"** again.
> 
> You only need to do this the very first time you run this version of the app.

<!-- Optional: Add Windows/Linux instructions if applicable later -->
